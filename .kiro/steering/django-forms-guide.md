When using django forms we should take a bit of a wierd aproach compared to the regular aproach. You might wonder why rightfully. the answer to that is it becomes by design very complex to maintain the form with its styles outside of html (for example by using something like crispy-forms we include the tailwindcss inside python but this becomes harder to maintain)

For this reason we will just outright hardcode the form as djangos backend would expect in html. The backend doesnt really care whether we hard code it manually in html or not as long as we use the right name fields it can never know. and in return we get a very maintainable tailwindcss based form which we can fully control when it comes to design. There is really no need to reinvent a more pythonic or django way to do forms in my opinion.
