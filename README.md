# Better (WIP)

My take on a score based life management system. Visualize how you did today, yesterday and every single day in the past based on targets and importance levels (rules) you yourself set.

A self-accountabilty system that shows you the better days. and the days you sucked in numbers.

> Winning is an absolute. There’s a score, a dollar sign, a grade, a number on the scale. 
> It doesn’t matter how hard you worked, how many hours you spent at the gym or office, how talented you are, how you sacrificed. Did you win?
